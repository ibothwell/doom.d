# doom.d

My initial [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration.

All of my customizations are based off the my [original emacs config](https://github.com/ibothwell/emacs.d) 
which stands on the shoulders of the work thankfully developed by Achint Sandhu [here](https://github.com/sandhu/emacs.d)

## Install
To install follow the directions provide on the Doom Emacs site. I have done not modifications to the base install.

Then simply check this folder and replace the contents of `~/.doom.d` with the contents of this folder.
